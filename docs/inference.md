# Inference Guide

Deploy trained policies for evaluation and production use. Positronic supports local inference (model loaded on robot/simulator machine) and inference with remote server (model runs on a separate GPU server, over a websocket or gRPC).

## Inference with Remote Server

Positronic's unified session protocol connects any hardware to any model (LeRobot, GR00T, OpenPI); the same frames cross either wire, a websocket or gRPC. A heavy model (OpenPI needs ~62GB, GR00T ~8GB) runs on GPU hardware separate from the robot/simulator machine.

Each server loads one model at launch and serves it through a `PolicyDeployment`: a
client processor stack and an optional server codec. The handshake declares the
client stack, which `RemotePolicy` builds automatically. Each vendor supplies named
deployment configs as server subcommands, such as `groot-server droid`.

**Start inference server:**
```bash
# The subcommand pairs a model with a pipeline; --model.* names the checkpoint
# LeRobot (SmolVLA — 0.4.x)
cd docker && docker compose run --rm --service-ports lerobot-server ee \
  --model.checkpoints_dir=~/checkpoints/lerobot/experiment_v1/

# LeRobot (ACT — 0.3.3)
cd docker && docker compose run --rm --service-ports lerobot-0_3_3-server ee \
  --model.checkpoints_dir=~/checkpoints/lerobot/experiment_v1/

# GR00T
cd docker && docker compose run --rm --service-ports -v "$PWD/groot-data:/data" groot-server droid \
  --model.model_source=/data/checkpoints/experiment_v1/

# OpenPI (--pipeline.ee_frame states the EE frame the checkpoint speaks; None means the rig's `default`)
cd docker && docker compose run --rm --service-ports openpi-server ee \
  --model.checkpoints_dir=~/checkpoints/openpi/experiment_v1/ \
  --pipeline.ee_frame=None
```

Check server: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/keepalive` answers once the model has loaded and warmed.

**Run inference:**
```bash
# Simulation
uv run positronic eval run --eval=.sim.positronic.stack_cubes \
  --policy=.remote \
  --policy.address.host=localhost --policy.address.port=8000 \
  --output_dir=~/datasets/inference_logs/exp_v1

# Hardware — the same command against a rig's eval
uv run positronic eval run --eval=.real.droid.pick_place \
  --policy=.remote \
  --policy.address.host=gpu-server --policy.address.port=8000 \
  --output_dir=~/datasets/inference_logs/franka_eval
```

`--eval` names what runs: a whole benchmark, a suite, or one task. [Evaluation](evaluation.md) lists the targets and the flags that shape a sweep — `--eval.trial_count`, `--charge_inference_time`, `--timing`. (`positronic-inference sim` is a shorthand for the same command with `--eval=.sim.positronic.stack_cubes` fixed.)

**Flags name the endpoint.** `--policy.wire` is the transport by name — `websocket`, `websocket_tls`, `websocket_unix`, `grpc` or `grpc_tls`; the `_tls` members dial a TLS front, and `websocket_unix` a Unix socket (below). Each wire then takes its own address, and `--policy.address.*` fills it: `--policy.address.host` and `--policy.address.port` for a network wire (`8000` is every vendor server's websocket default; a TLS front answers on `443`), or `--policy.address=@positronic.cfg.policy.socket_address --policy.address.uds=…` for `websocket_unix`, which names no host and no port. `--policy.address.query` carries the session params:

```bash
uv run positronic eval run --eval=.sim.positronic.stack_cubes \
  --policy=.remote \
  --policy.wire=websocket_tls --policy.address.host=gpu-server --policy.address.port=443 \
  --policy.address.query='fps=10'
```

**A Unix socket reaches a server on the same machine.** `--policy.wire=websocket_unix --policy.address=@positronic.cfg.policy.socket_address --policy.address.uds=/run/policy.sock` dials the socket a server bound with `--websocket.served_address=@positronic.offboard.server.socket_at --websocket.served_address.uds=/run/policy.sock`, over no network. `--policy.address.query` names session params as it does on any other wire; this wire's address has no host and no port to fill. Use this carrier for a policy process that runs beside the harness and has no network interface of its own.

**Credentials stay off the command line.** A token rides a header instead. It stays off the command line too: `save_run_metadata()` writes `sys.argv` beside the run's episodes. Three policy configs build the header:

- `.authed_remote` — a bearer token read from `AUTH_TOKEN`, which it raises about when that is unset. Every endpoint [`workflows/nebius/serve.sh`](../workflows/nebius/README.md) creates is gated this way, whether the server checks the token itself or a proxy in front of it does.
- `.nebius_remote` — the same header, with the Nebius token fetched for you (see [the Nebius workflow README](../workflows/nebius/README.md#authenticated-inference)).
- `.file_authed_remote` — any header set, read from the JSON object in the file at `--policy.headers.path`.

```bash
uv run positronic eval run --eval=.sim.positronic.stack_cubes \
  --policy=.file_authed_remote \
  --policy.wire=websocket_tls --policy.address.host=<endpoint-managed-host> --policy.address.port=443 \
  --policy.headers.path=~/.config/endpoint/headers.json \
  --output_dir=~/datasets/inference_logs/exp_v1
```

**Session parameters** are `--policy.address.query`, a query string: the server applies them as overrides to its pipeline config, so you can tune the served pipeline without restarting the server. Keys are dotted paths into that config and values are JSON literals, forwarded verbatim so they arrive exactly as written (`fps=10`, `pad=false`, `name="s3"`).

Session parameters reach the pipeline only. The model (`--model.checkpoints_dir`, `--model.checkpoint`, device...) is fixed at server launch, and a key that names it is an unknown key. A server serves one checkpoint; to serve another, start another server. Bad params fail at connect with a clear server error. Full rules in the [Offboard README](../positronic/offboard/README.md).

**The server declares data preparation.** Its client stack can contain
`RestrictImageSize` to bound uploaded frames and `ChangeEEFrame` to convert poses.
The client JPEG-encodes each frame unless the deployment sets `compress_images=False`. The
websocket wire adds no other compression: neither end accepts permessage-deflate. The model returns
full chunks; client scheduling emits commands immediately when they become due.

**The handshake is recorded as the server sent it.** Every episode stores the server's handshake metadata under `inference.policy.server.*`. The client reads the declared stack and `compress_images` from it and records the rest without a check. A `prompt` field there is the server's own field, and positronic gives it no meaning. The instruction an episode sent is `task`.

## Running on the same machine

Run the model server beside the robot or simulator, then connect with
`--policy=.remote --policy.address.host=localhost`. A Unix socket also works, using
the address configuration above. The same model and processor APIs apply whether
the server is local or on another machine.

## Public VLM / LLM APIs

The [LLM policy](../positronic/vendors/llm/README.md) calls OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint directly from the rig. It needs no Positronic inference server. Install the matching provider extra (`llm-openai`, `llm-anthropic`, or `llm-google`) and select `--policy=@positronic.vendors.llm.policy.llm` with a model name and provider credentials.

The model sees measured hand state and camera images, then requests one bounded absolute hand move at a time. The existing robot driver performs inverse kinematics. Each episode has its own conversation and transcript.

## Who Decides Episode Boundaries

Something has to say when an episode starts and when it finishes.

**Unattended — `positronic eval run`:** a driver walks the eval's tasks, `--eval.trial_count=10` episodes back-to-back. Each ends when its benchmark reports the task done, or when the task's timeout expires (`--eval.timeout=60`, seconds per episode). An episode that fails on a `pimm.SignalError` runs its task again, and two such failures of one task in a row end the run. Any other failed episode ends the run. Batch evaluation with nobody in the loop.

**Keyboard — `positronic-inference real`:** press `s` to start an episode, `p` to stop and save, `q` to quit. Headless — it renders nothing — and it takes `--next_task`, `--embodiment`, `--policy` and `--output_dir`. `--next_task` names the config that makes each trial, one per press. The default draws a new start pose for every one of them. Set the goal with `--next_task.instruction="..."`. An episode that fails is logged, and `s` starts the next one. Manual evaluation and debugging on hardware.

**Browser — `positronic-inference web`:** a page at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` shows a live tile for each camera. Start opens an episode on the trial `--next_task` makes. Finish ends it with a pass or fail verdict. The instruction field shows the configured instruction. An edit becomes an override, which stays in force until Reset to configured, and the field locks while an episode runs. It takes the flags of `real`, plus `--host` and `--port` for the page. The page serves on localhost; reach it from another machine over an SSH tunnel. `--host=0.0.0.0` lets anyone who reaches the machine start an episode. An episode that fails, for example on a home move that stops short, records nothing. The page shows its error, and Start runs the next episode. End run on the page, or Ctrl-C, ends the run: each device runs its own shutdown, and the program exits. The page refuses End run while an episode is open. Each recorded episode stores the instruction it sent (`task`), whether that was an override (`eval.instruction_overridden`), its number in the run (`eval.trial_index`), and the verdict (`eval.success`).

Anything richer — a foot pedal, a rig UI — is a driver of its own rather than a plug-in. A driver is any control system with a `perform_task` caller, and it brings the policy and the output path: each ask carries the policy definition the episode runs and names where it records. The answer carries the episode's terminal payload or the error that failed it, and the driver decides whether that error ends the run. `run_world` builds the world around it — the harness, the recorder, the devices, and every wire between them. `KeyboardOperator` in [`positronic/inference.py`](../positronic/inference.py) is the worked example, in about thirty lines.

**A device that gives no data fails only its episode.** A device driver emits a `pimm.SignalError` on its observation signal while the device gives no data, for example after a camera drops off the USB bus. The harness reads that value before the policy does. It discards the episode, records nothing, and answers the ask with that `SignalError`. The harness does not run the task again. The driver decides what follows, as it does for any failed episode: `positronic eval run` runs the task once more. The device driver keeps the error until the harness asks the device to be ready. A device driver that stops emitting without a `SignalError` leaves the policy on the last value it sent.

**Every device is ready before an episode starts.** Before each episode, the harness calls each handler in `Embodiment.ready_handlers` with no argument, then the prepare handlers that the task names. A healthy device answers at once. A device that holds an error repairs first and answers when it gives data again. A device that cannot repair answers with its error. That error fails the ask, and the harness keeps serving asks. The next ask calls the handler again.

## Recording and Replay

Specify `--output_dir` to record runs as Positronic datasets. Recorded data includes robot state, camera feeds, actions, gripper commands, and timing information.

Replay recorded runs: `uv run positronic-server --dataset.path=~/datasets/inference_logs/run1 --port=5001` and open `http://localhost:5001` to review episodes, identify failure modes, and extract clips for dataset augmentation.

## Evaluation Workflow

Run inference with recording, review in Positronic server, score manually (success/partial/failure), repeat for 10-50 trials, calculate success rate and note common failure modes. To compare checkpoints, start one server for each and run the same evaluation against each server.

**Iteration:** Evaluate checkpoint → identify failures in server → collect targeted demos for failure modes → append to dataset → retrain → re-evaluate. Convergence typically occurs after 3-5 iterations.
