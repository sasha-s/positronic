# TODO: one lifecycle for every trial: sim or real, attended or not.
# Roadmap:
# [✓] ``privileged``, ``done`` and ``reset`` are per-run: they move to ``Eval``.
# [✓] ``trials`` becomes ``list[Task]``, one per trial; a ``Task`` carries what ``reset`` is called with.
# [✓] A driver walks the list and calls ``perform_task(task)``; the Harness keeps no plan.
# [✓] ``charge_inference_time`` is a ``Task`` field, not a context key.
# [✓] Split the reset token from the policy input: the instruction is all a trial gives the policy.
# [✓] Homing becomes a ``prepare`` call the arm and gripper answer once in place; ``Command.home`` goes with it.
# [✓] A trial's reset is every ``prepare`` it asks for — scene, arm, gripper — and it opens once all answer.
# [✓] ``command.Reset`` goes: a robot is moved by a ``prepare`` call that names where to go.
# [✓] The recorder keeps what is on the wire when it opens, and a producer publishes the scene as it answers.
# [✓] A config makes each attended trial, so the keyboard path makes none of its own.
# [✓] A task source makes the plan when the world starts.
# [✓] One runner builds the world for both.
# [✓] A session reports the model's meta, so a policy holds none.
# [✓] The episode call carries the session that runs it, so the Harness holds no policy.
# [✓] The episode call names where it records, so the Harness holds no dataset.
# [✓] A benchmark answers ``tasks(spec)``, so positronic holds no task table of its own.
# [ ] A task carries its instruction as data, so no trial reads it after the reset.
# [ ] A sim eval config names a selection, and a spec flag narrows it to one task.
# [ ] A task names its model, and a routed policy serves the mix.
# [ ] A session logs the trials it ran, and a later run replays that log.
