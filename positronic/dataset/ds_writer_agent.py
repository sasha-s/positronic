    Listens on `command` for `DsWriterCommand` messages controlling the

    opens that dataset, once per name — and applies `static_data`. A `START_EPISODE` that names no dataset
    opens an episode that records nowhere. The opening turn records what each
    input holds, whenever that value was produced. While open, each updated input
    signal (from `inputs`) is appended with its emission and first-delivery coordinates.
    `STOP_EPISODE` and `ABORT_EPISODE` are handled after that turn's inputs, so
    the trial's last frame is recorded before STOP finalizes the writer; samples
    timestamped after STOP — whatever the next trial's prepare moves, or sensor
    data the async real path queues — are dropped, and ABORT discards the
    episode. Invalid or out-of-order commands are ignored with a log message.
    An input that carries a ``pimm.SignalError`` records nothing.

    ``virtual_time`` makes the recorder yield to ride the producer's clock — sim lockstep, where the
    simulator is the sole time-master — instead of pacing itself at ``poll_hz`` (real/background).
